# Extracting-subtrees-from-dependency-trees
The project will involve automatically extracting subtrees from the treebank. ▸ Generalizing the structures and coming up with a subtree bank representing basic structures.▸ Automatically extract all subtrees possible from a given tree bank . ▸ Create a sub-tree bank where each group consists of sub trees based on similar POS tag , CHUNK tag ,for the parent &amp; child and dependency between them .
